## 🔍What is API Testing?
API Testing is one of the type of software testing that focused on **functionality, reliability, performance, and security**.

##  🔬 What is tested?
1. Functional testing
    - Endpoint validation
    - Response status
    - Data integrity
2. Performance testing: Check how is the response time in normal load or heavy load
3. Security testing
4. Verifying API match with API specification

## 1️⃣ First step before testing
Before testing API we have to know the **purpose** of the API. For example in this project there are API from RESTcountries. One of the API is [GET] All Countries. In the [GET] All countries the purpose of this API is to retrieve all countries lists include teritories country, dependencies, and regions with limited recognition. So that, we know what needs to be verified.
